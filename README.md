  Hello! Here is the app I created for the Fetch iOS Apprentice Coding Challenge.<br>
  I chose to build it using SwiftUI, and hope you find it covers all required guidelines.<br>
  I look forward to discussing some decisions I made and certain areas that could be improved.<br>
  Thank you for your time, please let me know if have any issues.
